Recommendations and guides for new SocialCoin employees

## Editor:
We use Atom.

Installation for **[Linux](https://atom.io/)**

Installation for **[Windows](https://flight-manual.atom.io/getting-started/sections/installing-atom/#platform-linux)**

## Configuration
Install the "[teletype](https://atom.io/packages/teletype)" package so we can have collaboration sessions. [Link Atom to Github](https://github.atom.io/) so we can connect to the repository, and push/pull natively without a 3rd party.

## Need help?
Feel free to contact me, HolySuicidalTurkey, in the employee Discord. If you're reading this guide, you likely already have access anyways.
